Your task is to list all APT-technique(s) that you can recognize from a given code-sample, referring to, but not limiting yourself to, the APT-techniques in the provided knowledge-base.

Here are a few examples of code samples, the knowledge base, and the correct techniques to be recognized, which exemplify your task.

"""
Example-1:
 Code-sample: ''' < example code-sample > '''
 Knowledge-base: ''' < example knowledge-base: implementations and descriptions of several techniques. 
 					   IMPORTANT: The implementations here should not overlap with those in the code sample (i.e., the code sample should include 'unseen' implementations) > '''
 Answer: ''' < Ground-truth techniques for the example code sample, along with the corresponding pieces of code > '''

Example-2: ...
