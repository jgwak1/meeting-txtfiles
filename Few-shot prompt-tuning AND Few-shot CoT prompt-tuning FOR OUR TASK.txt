
### 'Few-shot prompt' template for our task ###

Your task is to list all APT-technique(s) that you can recognize from a given code-sample, referring to, but not limiting yourself to, the APT-techniques in the provided knowledge-base.

Here are a few examples of code sample, knowledge base, and correct techniques to be recognized, which exemplify your task.

"""
Example-1:
 Code-sample: ''' < example code-sample > '''
 Knowledge-base: ''' < example knowledge-base: implementations and descriptions of several techniques. 
 					   IMPORTANT: The implementations here should not overlap with code in the example code-sample 
 					   (i.e., Avoid code-sample including 'seen' implementations) > '''
 Answer: ''' < Ground-truth techniques of example code-sample, along with their corresponding code-segments > '''

Example-2: ...
"""

Here is the code sample which you should perform your task. The knowledge base is the uploaded "XX" file.

''' < test code-sample > '''
