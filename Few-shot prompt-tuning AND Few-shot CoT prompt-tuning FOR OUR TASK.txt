Your task is to list all APT-technique(s) that you can recognize from a given code-sample, referring to, but not limitting yourself to the APT-techniques in the provided knowledge-base.


Here are a few examples of the code-sample, knowledge-base, and correct techniques to be recognized which exemplifies your task.

"""
Example-1:
 Code-sample: ''' <code-sample> '''
 Knowledge-base: ''' < Knowledge (implementations, description) of several techniques. 
 					   IMPORTANT: Implementations here should not overlap with those in code-sample (i.e., Code-sample should include 'unseen implementations' )> '''
 Answer: ''' < Ground-truth techniques along with corresponding 'pieces of code' > '''

Example-2:
		...
"""

Here is the actual code-sample you should perform your task. Now the knowledge-base is the uploaded "XX" file.
